# Daydream-Maker

## Feb 13th: 

### Big Picture Plan:
1) Test with images from [facial_recognition](https://github.com/21-projects-for-deep-learning/face_recognition/tree/b9e5ad224f9b19f9da3ad6d4a3b9a856adfcecfa)
2) Apply frequently used packages for image recognition (for example: to convert images with [PIL image](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html)
3) Implement image recognition functionality and test with Test Images
4) Extend our functionionality on other images (non-human?) 
5) If functionality holds, extend to IMC data
6) Implement functionality for IMC data analysis: test with [astir](https://github.com/camlab-bioml/astir)

### Structure of the project:
1) Language: Python on top of tensorflow/pytorch? Read up on the pros/cons of each then choose. 


### Checkpoints: 
1) complete tasks (1) and (2) in __Big Picture Plan__ above in parallel --> we will make 2 separate personal repositories to reproduce the facial recognition workflow. 


Further updates when checkpoint (1) has been reached...
